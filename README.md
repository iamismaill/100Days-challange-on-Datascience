# 100 Days- challange- on Datascience Coding

Hello folks !!

Today i want to start 100 days challenge of Data Science , Through this challenge I want to cover these topics 
1. Statistics in python 
2. More about Numpy & Pandas Library
3. Data Visualization
4. Machine Learning 


I want to dedicate at least 3 hours of every day for the next 100 days in studying ,coding and at the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned and what is the plan for the next day.

The main goal of my challenge is to relearn ,share and implement Data science concepts from begginer to advanced.
